# Create Your Wallet

AceBot creates your first wallet automatically when you start the bot. You can also create additional wallets anytime.

## Automatic Wallet Creation

When you first open AceBot and tap **Start**, the bot:

1. Creates a new wallet with a unique address
2. Encrypts your private key with AES-256-GCM
3. Assigns it a default name ("Wallet 001")
4. Sets it as your default trading wallet

<Info>
Your private keys are encrypted and stored securely. They are never displayed in Telegram chat.
</Info>

## Create Additional Wallets

You can create unlimited wallets for different trading strategies or chains.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Wallet Manager">
    Tap **👛 Wallets** from the main menu or use the `/wallet` command.

    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Name and Confirm">

## Managing Multiple Wallets

With multiple wallets, you can:
- **Separate strategies** — Use different wallets for different trading approaches
- **Organize by chain** — Dedicate wallets to specific networks
- **Distribute risk** — Keep funds spread across multiple wallets

<Tip>
Use the **Fund Distribution** feature to split funds from one wallet to multiple wallets, or **Fund Consolidation** to gather funds back into one.
