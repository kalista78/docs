Your AceBot wallet works on all supported chains. The same wallet address can hold:

- ETH on Ink
- HYPE on HyperEVM
- XPL on Plasma

When you switch chains, your wallet automatically shows the balance for that chain.

<Info>
Each chain has its own native token for gas fees. Make sure you have native tokens on each chain you want to trade on.

## Chain-Specific Features

While the core trading experience is the same across chains, some features may vary:

| Feature | Sonic | Monad | Ink | HyperEVM | Plasma |
|---------|-------|-------|-----|----------|--------|
| Direct Trading | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Limit Orders | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| DCA | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

| Wrap/Unwrap | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Bridge Between Chains

Need to move funds between chains? Use the built-in bridge:

1. Tap **🌉 Bridge** from the main menu
2. Select source chain and destination chain
3. Choose amount (25%, 50%, MAX, or custom)
4. Confirm the bridge transaction

The bridge uses Li.Fi to find the best route for your transfer.

<Tip>
Bridging takes a few minutes depending on the chains involved. You'll receive status updates as the transfer progresses.
</Tip>

## Per-Chain Settings

Some settings can be configured per chain:

- **Default Buy Amount** — Set different buy amounts for each chain
- **Rakeback Tiers** — Your trading volume tier is tracked separately per chain
- **Referral Rewards** — Claim rewards independently for each chain
