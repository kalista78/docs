</Steps>

## What to Deposit

Deposit the native token for your chosen chain:

| Chain | Native Token | What to Send |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| 🔵 Sonic | S | SONIC tokens |
| 🟣 Monad | MON | MONAD tokens |
| 🖤 Ink | ETH | Ethereum |
| ⚡ HyperEVM | HYPE | HYPE tokens |
| 🔴 Plasma | XPL | XPL tokens |

<Warning>
Always send tokens on the correct network. Sending tokens on the wrong chain may result in permanent loss.
</Warning>

## Funding Methods

### From a Centralized Exchange

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Withdrawal">
    On your exchange (Binance, Coinbase, OKX, etc.), go to **Withdraw**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Token and Network">
    Choose the token you want to send and **make sure to select the correct network**.

    For example:
    - For Sonic: Select "Sonic Network" (not Ethereum)
    - For Monad: Select "Monad Network"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Paste Your AceBot Address">
    Paste the wallet address you copied from AceBot.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm and Send">
    Enter the amount and confirm the withdrawal. Funds typically arrive within minutes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### From Another Wallet

If you have tokens in MetaMask, Rabby, or another wallet:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect to Correct Network">
    Make sure your wallet is connected to the same network as your AceBot wallet.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send Tokens">
    Send native tokens to your AceBot wallet address.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Using the Bridge

If you have tokens on a different chain, use AceBot's built-in bridge:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Bridge">
    Tap **🌉 Bridge** from the main menu.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Chains">
    Choose your source chain (where tokens are) and destination chain (where you want them).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Amount">
    Select the amount to bridge and confirm.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
The bridge requires you to already have funds on one chain. If you're starting fresh, deposit from an exchange first.
</Info>

## Check Your Balance

After sending tokens:

1. Wait a few minutes for the transaction to confirm
2. Tap **💰 Balances** or use `/balance`
3. Your balance updates automatically (refreshes every 15 seconds)

## Recommended Starting Amounts

For testing and getting familiar with AceBot:

| Chain | Suggested Starting Amount |
|-------|--------------------------|
| 🔵 Sonic | 50-100 S |
| 🟣 Monad | 10-50 MON |
| 🖤 Ink | 0.01-0.05 ETH |
| ⚡ HyperEVM | 5-20 HYPE |
| 🔴 Plasma | 100-500 XPL |

<Tip>
Start small until you're comfortable with the trading flow. You can always add more funds later.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My balance shows 0 after sending">
    - Wait 2-3 minutes for the transaction to confirm
    - Make sure you sent to the correct address
    - Verify you selected the correct network on the sending side
    - Use `/balance` to force a refresh
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I sent to the wrong network">
    If you sent tokens on the wrong network, they may be inaccessible. Contact the exchange or use recovery tools if available. This is why starting with small amounts is recommended.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Transaction is pending for too long">
    Network congestion can delay transactions. Check a block explorer for your chain to see the transaction status.
