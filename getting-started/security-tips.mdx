# Security Best Practices

Your funds are only as safe as your security habits. Follow these guidelines to protect your AceBot wallet.

## How AceBot Protects You

### Encrypted Private Keys
Your private keys are encrypted with **AES-256-GCM** — the same encryption used by banks and governments. Keys are encrypted before storage and can only be accessed with your account.

### Keys Never Shown in Chat
Private keys are **never displayed in Telegram messages**. This prevents accidental exposure through screenshots or message history.

### Auto-Delete Sensitive Messages
When you import a wallet by pasting a private key, your message is **automatically deleted** to prevent it from remaining in chat history.

### Token Security Scanning
AceBot integrates with **GoPlus** to scan tokens for:
- Honeypot contracts (tokens you can't sell)
- Rug pull indicators
- Malicious contract code
- Unusual trading restrictions

<Info>
GoPlus security scanning is enabled by default. You can toggle it in Settings, but we recommend keeping it on.
</Info>

## Your Security Responsibilities

### Never Share Your Private Keys

<Warning>
AceBot support will **NEVER** ask for your private keys. Anyone asking for keys is a scammer.
</Warning>

Your private keys give full control over your funds. Never share them with anyone, including:
- "Support" staff in DMs
- "Admins" claiming to help
- Websites asking for keys
- Anyone, ever

### Verify Bot Identity

Before interacting with AceBot, confirm you're using the real bot:
- Official bot: **@AceBotApp**
- Official community: Check the verified community link

Scammers create fake bots with similar names. Always verify before depositing funds.

### Start with Small Amounts

When trying new features or trading new tokens:
1. Start with a small test amount
2. Verify the transaction works correctly
3. Scale up once you're confident

### Back Up Your Wallet Access

Your AceBot wallet is tied to your Telegram account. Protect your Telegram account:
- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on Telegram
- Use a strong, unique password
- Never share your Telegram login code

### Be Cautious with Token Links

Token contract addresses can come from anywhere. Before trading:
- Verify the contract address from official sources
- Check if GoPlus flags any security issues
- Research the token on DEX Screener or similar platforms

## Security Settings in AceBot

### GoPlus Security Toggle

Enable or disable token security scanning:

1. Tap **⚙️ Settings**
2. Find **🛡️ GoPlus Security**
3. Toggle on (recommended) or off

When enabled, AceBot will warn you about potentially risky tokens before trading.

### Wallet Access Through Secure Portal

If you need to access your private keys (for migration or backup):
- AceBot provides a secure external portal
- Never type keys directly in Telegram
- Access keys only on a secure, private device

## Common Scams to Avoid

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Fake Support Scams" icon="user-secret">
    Scammers pose as AceBot support in your DMs. They may:
    - Ask for private keys "to fix an issue"
    - Send links to fake websites
    - Claim your account is suspended

    **Reality**: Real support never DMs first and never asks for keys.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Phishing Bots" icon="robot">
    Fake bots with names like "@AceBot_Official" or "@AceBotSupport":
    - May look identical to the real bot
    - Ask you to "verify" your wallet
    - Steal any keys you enter

    **Reality**: The only official bot is @AceBotApp.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Honeypot Tokens" icon="honey-pot">
    Tokens designed to trap your funds:
    - You can buy but not sell
    - High tax on sells (90%+)
    - Contract can freeze your tokens

    **Reality**: GoPlus scans for these. Always check security warnings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rug Pulls" icon="parachute-box">
    Developers abandon projects after:
    - Draining liquidity pools
    - Dumping their token holdings
