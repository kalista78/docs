# DCA Orders (Dollar Cost Averaging)

DCA is a strategy where you buy or sell fixed amounts at regular intervals, regardless of price. This reduces the impact of volatility and removes the stress of timing the market.

## Why Use DCA?

- **Reduces timing risk** — You don't need to pick the perfect entry
- **Smooths volatility** — Your average price evens out over time
- **Removes emotion** — Automated execution prevents panic decisions
- **Builds discipline** — Consistent investment regardless of market conditions

## Quick DCA Commands

```
/dcabuy 0x1234...5678    # Start DCA buy wizard
/dcasell 0x1234...5678   # Start DCA sell wizard
```

## Create a DCA Order

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open DCA Setup">
    From the main menu, start a trade and select **DCA** as the order type.

    Or use `/dcabuy` or `/dcasell` with a token address.

    [SCREENSHOT: Order type selection showing DCA option]
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Direction">
    Choose whether to DCA **Buy** or DCA **Sell**.

    - **DCA Buy**: Gradually accumulate a position
    - **DCA Sell**: Gradually exit a position
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Token Address">
    Paste the contract address of the token you want to DCA.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Wallet">
    Choose which wallet to use for the DCA orders.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Amount">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="DCA Buy">
        Enter the amount of native tokens to spend **per transaction**.

        **Presets:** 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50

        Example: 5 tokens per buy = 5 native tokens spent each interval.
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="DCA Sell">
        Enter the percentage of your position to sell **per transaction**.

        **Presets:** 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%

        Example: 10% per sell over 10 transactions = gradual full exit.
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Duration">
    Enter the total time window for your DCA strategy.

    **Default:** 60 minutes (configurable in Settings)

    Example: 120 minutes = DCA runs for 2 hours total.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Interval">
    Enter how often transactions should execute.

    **Default:** 5 minutes (configurable in Settings)

    Example: Every 5 minutes = one transaction every 5 minutes.

    <Info>
    **Total transactions** = Duration ÷ Interval

    120 min ÷ 5 min = 24 transactions
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and Confirm">
    Review your DCA setup:
    - Total transactions
    - Amount per transaction
    - Total amount (buy) or total percentage (sell)
    - Duration and interval

    Tap **Confirm** to start.

## How DCA Executes

Once confirmed:

1. **First transaction** executes immediately
2. **Subsequent transactions** execute at each interval
3. Each transaction is independent — some may succeed even if others fail
4. DCA continues until all transactions complete or you cancel

### Execution Example

**DCA Buy Setup:**
- Amount: 5 native tokens per transaction
- Duration: 60 minutes
- Interval: 10 minutes

**Result:**
- 6 transactions total (60 ÷ 10 = 6)
- Executes at: 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 minutes
- Total spent: 30 native tokens (6 × 5)

## Managing DCA Orders

### View Active DCA

Tap **📊 Positions** → **DCA Orders** to see your active DCA strategies.

Each order shows:
- Token being accumulated/sold
- Progress (X of Y transactions completed)
- Next scheduled transaction
- Average execution price

### Pause a DCA

Temporarily stop a DCA without cancelling:

1. Open **📊 Positions** → **DCA Orders**
2. Select your DCA order
3. Tap **⏸️ Pause**

Resume anytime with the **▶️ Resume** button.

### Cancel a DCA

Stop all remaining transactions:

1. Open **📊 Positions** → **DCA Orders**
2. Select your DCA order
3. Tap **🗑️ Stop**

Completed transactions are not reversed — you keep tokens already bought or sold.

## DCA vs Limit Orders

| Feature | DCA | Limit Orders |
|---------|-----|--------------|
| **Trigger** | Time-based | Price-based |
| **Execution** | Multiple transactions | Single transaction |
| **Best for** | Reducing timing risk | Targeting specific prices |
| **Requires** | Patience | Price prediction |

<Tip>
Combine DCA with limit orders: Use DCA to accumulate, then set limit orders for profit-taking.
</Tip>

## Important Considerations

<Warning>
Each DCA transaction incurs gas fees. For very small amounts, gas may eat into your trades. Consider larger amounts with fewer transactions if gas costs are high.
</Warning>

- DCA doesn't guarantee profits — it averages your entry/exit
- Transactions may fail due to slippage or low balance
- Keep enough native tokens for gas throughout the DCA period
