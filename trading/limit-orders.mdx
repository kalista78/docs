# Limit Orders

Limit orders let you set trades that execute automatically when specific conditions are met. No need to watch charts — AceBot handles it for you.

## What Are Limit Orders?

A limit order is an instruction to buy or sell when:
- Token reaches a specific **price**
- Token reaches a specific **market cap**
- Token moves by a specific **percentage**

Once your condition is met, the trade executes automatically.

## Quick Limit Order Command

```
/limit 0x1234...5678 5 @0.0015 24H
```

This creates a buy order for 5 tokens when price reaches $0.0015, valid for 24 hours.

### Command Syntax

```
/limit <token_address> <amount|percent%> <trigger> [duration]
```

**Trigger types:**
- `@price` — Target price (e.g., `@0.0015`)
- `%:+/-pct` — Percentage change (e.g., `%:+25` or `%:-30`)
- `mc:value` — Market cap target (e.g., `mc:500k`, `mc:2m`, `mc:1.5b`)

**Duration:** How long the order stays active (e.g., `24H`, `3D`)

### Examples

```
/limit 0xabc...def 5 @0.001          # Buy when price hits $0.001
/limit 0xabc...def 50% %:-20         # Sell 50% when price drops 20%
/limit 0xabc...def 10 mc:500k        # Buy when market cap hits 500k
/limit 0xabc...def 25% %:+100 3D     # Sell 25% when price doubles, valid 3 days
```

## Take Profit & Stop Loss

When creating a limit buy order, you can set automatic exits:

### Take Profit
Automatically sells when your profit target is reached:
- Set as percentage gain from entry
- Choose how much to sell (25%, 50%, 100%)
- Multiple take profit levels possible

### Stop Loss
Automatically sells to limit losses:
- Set as percentage loss from entry
- Usually set to sell entire position
- Protects against major downturns

**Example Combined Order:**
- Buy when price hits $0.001
- Take profit: Sell 50% at +100% gain
- Stop loss: Sell 100% at -30% loss

## Order Expiration

Limit orders expire after their set duration. If not triggered:
- Order is automatically cancelled
- No tokens are spent
- You receive no notification (check Positions to verify)

<Tip>
For important levels, set longer durations (3-5 days). For quick trades, 24 hours is usually sufficient.
</Tip>

## Important Notes

<Warning>
Limit orders are not guaranteed to execute at your exact price. Slippage may occur, especially for:
- Low liquidity tokens
- Fast-moving markets
- Large order sizes
</Warning>

- Orders execute at the next available price once triggered
- Gas fees apply when the order executes
- Orders require you to have sufficient balance when triggered
