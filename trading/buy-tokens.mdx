# Buy Tokens

Buying tokens on AceBot is fast and simple. Paste a token address, choose your amount, and confirm.

## Quick Buy with Commands

The fastest way to buy is with the `/buy` command:

```
/buy 0x1234...5678 5
```

This buys 5 native tokens worth of the specified token immediately.

### Command Syntax

```
/buy <token_address> [amount]
```

- **token_address** — The contract address of the token you want to buy
- **amount** — (Optional) Amount of native tokens to spend (defaults to your default buy amount)

### Examples

```
/buy 0xabc...def           # Buy using default amount
/buy 0xabc...def 10        # Buy with 10 native tokens
/buy 0xabc...def 0.5       # Buy with 0.5 native tokens
```

## Buy Using the Menu

## Understanding the Trade Screen

When you're about to buy, you'll see:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Token** | Name, symbol, and contract address |
| **Price** | Current token price |
| **Market Cap** | Token's market capitalization |
| **24h Change** | Price change in last 24 hours |
| **Amount In** | How much native token you're spending |
| **Amount Out** | Estimated tokens you'll receive |
| **Slippage** | Maximum price movement you'll accept |

## Adjusting Slippage

Slippage protects you from price movements between when you place and when your trade executes.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="During Trade">
    On the confirmation screen, tap the slippage setting to adjust:
    - Low volatility tokens: 1-5%
    - Medium volatility: 5-15%
    - High volatility/low liquidity: 15-50%
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Set Default">
    Set your default slippage in **⚙️ Settings** → **Slippage**. This applies to all future trades unless overridden.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
If your trades keep failing, try increasing slippage. The token might be moving faster than your setting allows.
</Tip>

## Token Security Check

Before executing trades, AceBot checks the token for security issues:

- **Honeypot detection** — Can you sell the token?
- **High tax warning** — Are buy/sell taxes excessive?
- **Contract risks** — Any suspicious code detected?

If issues are found, you'll see a warning. You can still proceed, but do so with caution.

## Set Default Buy Amount

Tired of entering amounts every time? Set a default:

1. Tap **⚙️ Settings**
2. Select **Default Buy Amount**
3. Choose your chain and enter your preferred amount

Now when you use `/buy` without an amount, it uses your default.

## Buying Multiple Tokens

You can buy with multiple wallets simultaneously:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Buy Menu">
    Tap **🟢 Buy** from the main menu.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Token Address">
    Paste the token contract address.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Multiple Wallets">
    Instead of selecting one wallet, tap to select multiple. Each selected wallet will execute its own buy transaction.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm">
    The total amount will be split across selected wallets.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tips for Successful Buys

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Verify the contract address" icon="check">
    Always double-check the token address from official sources. Scammers create fake tokens with similar names.

  <Accordion title="Start with small amounts" icon="seedling">
    When buying a new token for the first time, test with a small amount to ensure everything works correctly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Check liquidity" icon="droplet">
    Low liquidity tokens may have high slippage. Check DEX Screener for liquidity depth before buying large amounts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Watch for security warnings" icon="shield-halved">

## What Happens After You Buy
