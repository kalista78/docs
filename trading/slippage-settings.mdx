# Slippage Settings

Slippage is the difference between the price you expect and the price you actually get. Understanding and configuring slippage correctly can save you money and prevent failed trades.

## What is Slippage?

When you submit a trade, the market can move before your transaction confirms. Slippage tolerance sets how much price movement you'll accept:

- **1% slippage** — Trade executes if price moves up to 1%
- **10% slippage** — Trade executes if price moves up to 10%
- **50% slippage** — Trade executes even with significant price movement

If the price moves beyond your slippage tolerance, the trade fails and you keep your tokens.

## When Slippage Matters

| Scenario | Slippage Risk | Recommended Setting |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|
| High liquidity token | Low | 0.5% - 3% |
| Medium liquidity | Medium | 3% - 10% |
| Low liquidity token | High | 10% - 30% |
| New token launch | Very High | 30% - 50% |
| Large trade size | Higher | Increase by 5-10% |

## Slippage Guidelines by Token Type

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Blue Chips">
    **Tokens:** Well-established tokens with high liquidity

    **Slippage:** 0.5% - 3%

    These tokens have deep liquidity and stable prices. Low slippage protects you from MEV attacks and unfavorable fills.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Mid-Cap">
    **Tokens:** Moderate liquidity, some volatility

    **Slippage:** 3% - 10%

    Balance between execution certainty and price protection.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Memecoins">
    **Tokens:** High volatility, variable liquidity

    **Slippage:** 10% - 30%

    Fast price movements require higher slippage for execution.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="New Launches">
    **Tokens:** Just launched, low liquidity

    **Slippage:** 30% - 50%

    Extreme volatility at launch. High slippage needed but increases risk of bad fills.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Common Slippage Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Trade keeps failing" icon="xmark">
    **Cause:** Slippage too low for the token's volatility.

    **Solution:** Increase slippage by 5-10% and retry. For very volatile tokens, try 20-30%.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Got less than expected" icon="money-bill-transfer">
    **Cause:** Price moved within your slippage tolerance.

    **Solution:** This is normal market behavior. For tighter control, reduce slippage (but trades may fail more often).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sandwich attack" icon="bread-slice">
    **Cause:** MEV bots exploit high slippage to extract value.

    **Solution:** Lower slippage on high-liquidity tokens. Consider trading smaller amounts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Large trade has high impact" icon="chart-bar">
    **Cause:** Your trade size moves the market.

    **Solution:** Split into multiple smaller trades, or use DCA to spread execution over time.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Understanding Price Impact

Price impact is different from slippage:

- **Slippage:** Price moves while your transaction is pending
- **Price Impact:** Your trade size moves the price

For large trades, check the estimated price impact on the confirmation screen. If it's high:
- Consider trading smaller amounts
- Use DCA to spread the trade
- Wait for more liquidity

## Slippage by Order Type

### Direct Orders
- Execute immediately at market price
- Lower slippage = more price protection
- Higher slippage = higher chance of execution

### Limit Orders
- Execute when trigger conditions are met
- Slippage applies to execution price
- Set higher since market may move fast at triggers

### DCA Orders
- Multiple transactions over time
- Each transaction uses your slippage setting
- Consider consistent slippage across all DCA trades

### Sniper Orders
- Execute instantly at liquidity add
- Need highest slippage (30-50%+)
- Speed matters more than precision

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Start low, increase as needed.** Begin with lower slippage and increase only if trades fail repeatedly.
</Tip>

1. **Know your token** — Check liquidity depth before trading
2. **Adjust by size** — Larger trades need higher slippage
3. **Check impact** — Review price impact on confirmation screen
4. **Split large trades** — Use DCA or multiple transactions
5. **Watch for warnings** — AceBot warns about high slippage risk
