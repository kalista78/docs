# Sell Tokens

Selling on AceBot is just as simple as buying. Choose to sell a percentage of your position or a specific amount.

## Quick Sell with Commands

The fastest way to sell is with the `/sell` command:

```
/sell 0x1234...5678 50%
```

This sells 50% of your token position immediately.

### Command Syntax

```
/sell <token_address> [amount|percentage%]
```

- **token_address** — The contract address of the token you want to sell
- **amount** — (Optional) Number of tokens to sell, OR
- **percentage%** — (Optional) Percentage of your balance to sell (add % symbol)

### Examples

```
/sell 0xabc...def           # Sell default percentage (usually 100%)
/sell 0xabc...def 50%       # Sell 50% of your position
/sell 0xabc...def 25%       # Sell 25% of your position
/sell 0xabc...def 1000      # Sell exactly 1000 tokens
```

## Partial vs Full Sells

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Partial Sells">
    **When to use:**
    - Taking profits while keeping exposure
    - Scaling out of a position
    - Reducing risk without fully exiting

    **Common strategies:**
    - Sell 25% at 2x
    - Sell 25% at 5x
    - Sell 25% at 10x
    - Keep 25% for long term
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Full Sells (100%)">
    **When to use:**
    - Exiting a position completely
    - Token shows security concerns
    - You've reached your target

    **Note:** Full sells liquidate your entire balance of that token.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Price Impact on Large Sells

Selling large amounts can move the market price against you:

- **Low impact** — Your sell is small relative to liquidity
- **Medium impact** — You might get a worse price
- **High impact** — Consider splitting into multiple sells

AceBot shows estimated price impact on the confirmation screen.

<Tip>
For large positions, consider selling in chunks (25% at a time) to minimize price impact.
</Tip>

## Failed Sell Transactions

If your sell fails:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Slippage too low">
    The price moved more than your slippage allows. Increase slippage and try again.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Insufficient gas">
    You don't have enough native tokens for gas. Add more native tokens to your wallet.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Token is a honeypot">
    Some tokens prevent selling. Check GoPlus security warnings before buying.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="High sell tax">
    Some tokens have high sell taxes (30%+). Factor this into your expected returns.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tips for Successful Sells

1. **Check liquidity depth** before selling large amounts
2. **Use appropriate slippage** — higher for volatile tokens
3. **Verify you're selling the right token** — check the contract address
4. **Consider gas costs** — small sells might not be worth the gas
