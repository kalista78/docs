# Fee Structure

Transparent breakdown of all fees you'll encounter when using AceBot.

## Trading Fees

### Platform Fee
| Fee | Rate |
|-----|------|
| **Trading Fee** | 1% of trade volume |

This fee applies to all buy and sell transactions.

### How Platform Fee Works
When you trade:
1. You pay 1% of the trade volume as platform fee
2. Based on your rakeback tier, you earn back 0-30%
3. If you were referred, you earn an additional 10% back

**Net fee examples:**

| Your Tier | Referral Bonus | Effective Fee |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| Rookie | No | 1.00% |
| Bronze | No | 0.95% |
| Silver | No | 0.90% |
| Gold | No | 0.85% |
| Platinum | No | 0.80% |
| Diamond | No | 0.75% |
| Apex | No | 0.70% |
| Any tier | +10% | -0.10% additional |

**Maximum rakeback:** 40% (minimum effective fee: 0.60%)

## Network Fees (Gas)

Gas fees are paid to the blockchain network, not to AceBot.

| Chain | Typical Gas Cost |
|-------|------------------|
| 🔵 Sonic | ~0.001-0.01 S per tx |
| 🟣 Monad | ~0.001-0.01 MON per tx |
| 🖤 Ink | ~0.0001-0.001 ETH per tx |
| ⚡ HyperEVM | ~0.001-0.01 HYPE per tx |
| 🔴 Plasma | ~0.01-0.1 XPL per tx |

Gas costs vary based on:
- Network congestion
- Transaction complexity
- Gas price settings

## Bridge Fees

When using the cross-chain bridge:

| Fee Type | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Bridge Protocol Fee** | Set by the bridge protocol (Li.Fi) |
| **Source Chain Gas** | Gas to initiate the bridge |
| **Destination Gas** | Sometimes included, sometimes paid separately |

Bridge fees are shown before you confirm each transaction.

**Typical total bridge cost:** $0.50 - $5.00 depending on route and congestion.

## Wallet Operation Fees

### Fund Distribution / Consolidation
| Fee | Rate |
|-----|------|
| **Platform Fee** | 0.1% of transferred amount |
| **Gas Fees** | Per transaction (network fee) |

These fees apply when distributing funds to multiple wallets or consolidating from multiple wallets.

### Regular Withdrawals
| Fee | Rate |
|-----|------|
| **Platform Fee** | None |
| **Gas Fee** | Standard network fee |

Standard withdrawals to external addresses only cost gas.

## Wrap/Unwrap Fees

| Fee | Rate |
|-----|------|
| **Platform Fee** | None |
| **Gas Fee** | Standard network fee |

Converting between native and wrapped tokens only costs gas.

## Limit Order / DCA Fees

When your automated orders execute:

| Fee Type | Rate |
|----------|------|
| **Trading Fee** | 1% (same as manual trades) |
| **Gas Fee** | Standard network fee per execution |

For DCA orders, each individual transaction incurs:
- The trading fee (with rakeback applied)
- A gas fee

**DCA cost consideration:** Many small DCA transactions can add up in gas. Consider larger, less frequent intervals if gas costs are significant.

## Fee Summary by Action

| Action | Platform Fee | Gas Fee |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Buy tokens | 1% | Yes |
| Sell tokens | 1% | Yes |
| Limit order (on execution) | 1% | Yes |
| DCA (per transaction) | 1% | Yes |
| Withdraw (standard) | None | Yes |
| Fund distribution | 0.1% | Yes |
| Fund consolidation | 0.1% | Yes |
| Wrap/Unwrap | None | Yes |
| Bridge | Protocol fee | Yes (both chains) |
| Claim rewards | None | Yes |

## Reducing Your Effective Fees

### 1. Build Your Rakeback Tier
Trade more to unlock higher rakeback:

| Tier | Rakeback | Effective Fee |
|------|----------|---------------|
| Apex | 30% | 0.70% |

### 2. Sign Up With Referral
Get an automatic +10% rakeback bonus on all trades.

### 3. Claim Rakeback Regularly
Don't leave rakeback unclaimed — it's your money back.

### 4. Optimize Gas Usage
- Trade during low-congestion periods
- Use larger DCA intervals (fewer transactions)
- Batch wallet operations when possible

## Rakeback Claim Thresholds

Minimum amounts required to claim rakeback:

| Chain | Minimum |
|-------|---------|
| 🔵 Sonic | 150 S |
| 🟣 Monad | 0.005 MON |
| 🖤 Ink | 0.005 ETH |
| ⚡ HyperEVM | 0.5 HYPE |
| 🔴 Plasma | 75 XPL |

## No Hidden Fees

AceBot is transparent about all fees:
- **No deposit fees** — Depositing to your wallet is free (just network transfer costs)
- **No wallet creation fees** — Create unlimited wallets at no cost
- **No subscription fees** — AceBot is free to use
- **No inactivity fees** — Your wallet is always available

## Fee Calculation Example

**Scenario:** You buy 100 S worth of tokens, you're Silver tier (10% rakeback) with referral bonus (+10%)

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Trade volume | 100 S |
| Platform fee (1%) | 1 S |
| Your rakeback (20%) | 0.2 S returned |
| Net fee paid | 0.8 S |
| Gas (estimate) | ~0.005 S |
| **Total cost** | **~0.805 S** |

Your effective fee rate: 0.8%
