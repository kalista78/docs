# Referral Program

Invite friends to AceBot and earn a portion of their trading fees. Both you and your referrals benefit.

## How It Works

1. **Share your referral link** with friends
2. **They sign up** through your link
3. **They trade** on any supported chain
4. **You both earn** — they get bonus rakeback, you get referral rewards

## Your Benefits as a Referrer

When someone trades using your referral:

| Time Period | Your Reward |
|-------------|-------------|
| First 30 days | **30%** of their effective trading fee |
| After 30 days | **20%** of their effective trading fee |

**Example:** Your referral pays $10 in fees:
- First 30 days: You earn $3
- After 30 days: You earn $2

## Their Benefits as a Referee

Users who sign up through a referral link receive:

- **+10% additional rakeback** on every trade
- Automatic bonus — no action needed
- Stacks with their volume tier rakeback

**Example:** A Silver tier user (10% rakeback) who was referred:
- Tier rakeback: 10%
- Referral bonus: +10%
- **Total rakeback: 20%**

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Share in trading communities" icon="users">

## Combining Referrals with Rakeback

Referral rewards and rakeback are separate systems that work together:

| You Earn | Source |
|----------|--------|
| Rakeback | Your own trading volume |
| Referral Rewards | Your referrals' trading volume |

Both can be claimed independently, and both contribute to your total earnings.
