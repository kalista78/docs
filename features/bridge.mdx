# Cross-Chain Bridge

AceBot includes a built-in bridge powered by Li.Fi, allowing you to move native tokens between all supported chains directly from Telegram.

## Supported Bridge Routes

You can bridge between any combination of:
- 🔵 **Sonic** (S)
- 🟣 **Monad** (MON)
- 🖤 **Ink** (ETH)
- ⚡ **HyperEVM** (HYPE)
- 🔴 **Plasma** (XPL)

<Info>
The bridge supports native tokens only. To bridge other tokens, first swap to the native token.
</Info>

## Bridge Fees and Costs

When you bridge, you pay:

| Cost | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Bridge Fee** | Fee charged by the bridge protocol |
| **Gas (Source)** | Gas to send tokens from source chain |
| **Gas (Destination)** | Gas to receive tokens on destination chain |

All costs are shown in USD before you confirm.

<Tip>
The MAX preset automatically reserves a small gas buffer (0.1%) to ensure you can pay for gas on the destination chain.
</Tip>

## Bridge Times

Typical bridge times by route:

| Route | Estimated Time |
|-------|----------------|
| Sonic ↔ Monad | 1-3 minutes |
| Sonic ↔ Ink | 2-5 minutes |
| Monad ↔ HyperEVM | 1-3 minutes |
| Any ↔ Plasma | 2-5 minutes |

Times can vary based on network congestion.

## Li.Fi Bridge Integration

AceBot uses Li.Fi as the bridge aggregator. Li.Fi:
- Finds the best route across multiple bridges
- Optimizes for speed and cost
- Supports all major bridging protocols

## Troubleshooting Bridge Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Bridge is taking too long" icon="clock">
    Bridge times can extend during network congestion. Check:
    - Source transaction on source chain explorer
    - Wait 10-15 minutes before investigating
    - Contact support if stuck over 30 minutes
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Received less than expected" icon="money-bill-wave">
    Within slippage tolerance is normal. If significantly less:
    - Check the quote slippage you set
    - Bridge routes may change based on liquidity
    - Contact support for major discrepancies
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Transaction failed" icon="xmark">
    Common causes:
    - Insufficient balance for gas
    - Slippage exceeded
    - Network congestion

    Your funds remain on the source chain. Try again with adjusted settings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tokens not showing on destination" icon="eye-slash">
    - Wait for full confirmation (check explorer)
    - Use `/balance` to force refresh
    - Make sure you're viewing the correct chain
    - Check the transaction on destination explorer
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Bridge Limits

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Minimum bridge | Varies by route (~$1-5 worth) |
| Maximum bridge | Limited by available liquidity |
| Gas buffer | 0.1% (10 BPS) reserved automatically |

## Best Practices

1. **Check quotes before bridging** — Fees vary by route and time
2. **Start with small amounts** — Test new routes with minimal funds
3. **Keep gas on both chains** — Ensure you can transact on destination
4. **Use MAX wisely** — MAX reserves gas buffer but bridges most of your balance

## Alternative Bridge Options

If the built-in bridge doesn't support your needs:

| Chain | Alternative Bridge |
|-------|-------------------|
| Sonic | Hyperlane Warp Route |
| Ink | Ink Bridge Hub |
| HyperEVM | LayerZero |
| Plasma | Stargate, Jumper |

Access these through the chain's official bridge interface.
