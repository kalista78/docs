# Rakeback Rewards

Rakeback returns a percentage of your trading fees based on how much you trade. The more you trade, the higher your tier and the more you earn back.

## How Rakeback Works

1. **You trade** on any supported chain
2. **Fees are charged** (1% of trading volume)
3. **Rakeback accrues** based on your tier
4. **You claim** when you're ready

## Volume Tiers

Your tier is determined by your **lifetime trading volume** on each chain:

### 🔵 Sonic Tiers

## Claiming Rules

| Rule | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Cooldown** | 12 hours between claims |
| **Daily Limit** | Maximum 10 claims per 24 hours |
| **Minimum Threshold** | Must meet chain-specific minimum |

### Minimum Claim Amounts

| Chain | Minimum |
|-------|---------|
| 🔵 Sonic | 150 S |
| 🟣 Monad | 0.005 MON |
| 🖤 Ink | 0.005 ETH |
| ⚡ HyperEVM | 0.5 HYPE |
| 🔴 Plasma | 75 XPL |

Rakeback below the minimum continues to accumulate.

## Rakeback Calculation Example

**Scenario:** You're Silver tier (10%) with referral bonus (+10%) = 20% rakeback

You make a trade:
- Trade volume: 1,000 S
- Platform fee (1%): 10 S
- Your rakeback (20%): 2 S

After the trade, 2 S is added to your pending rakeback.

## Tier Progression

Tiers are based on **lifetime volume**, not recent activity:
- Volume from all trades adds up
- You can only go up in tiers, never down
- Progress carries across sessions

<Tip>
Focus on consistent trading rather than occasional large trades. Volume accumulates over time.
</Tip>

## Rakeback vs Referral Rewards

| Aspect | Rakeback | Referral Rewards |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| **Source** | Your own trading | Others' trading |
| **Rate** | 0-30% (tier-based) | 20-30% (time-based) |
| **Earned from** | Fees you pay | Fees referrals pay |
| **Separate claim** | Yes | Yes |

Both systems work independently and stack with each other.
