# Wrap & Unwrap Tokens

Some DEXs and trading strategies require wrapped versions of native tokens. AceBot lets you easily convert between native and wrapped tokens.

## What is Wrapping?

Wrapping converts your native chain token to an ERC-20 compatible version:

| Chain | Native | Wrapped |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 🔵 Sonic | S | wS |
| 🟣 Monad | MON | wMON |
| 🖤 Ink | ETH | wETH |
| ⚡ HyperEVM | HYPE | wHYPE |
| 🔴 Plasma | XPL | wXPL |

**Why wrap?**
- Some trading pairs require wrapped tokens
- Certain DeFi protocols only accept ERC-20 tokens
- Some limit orders or advanced features may need wrapped versions

**Why unwrap?**
- Pay gas fees (requires native tokens)
- Transfer to exchanges that only accept native
- Reduce complexity in your wallet

## Quick Commands

```
/wrapnow 10          # Wrap 10 native tokens
/wrapnow 50%         # Wrap 50% of your native balance
/unwrapnow 5         # Unwrap 5 wrapped tokens
/unwrapnow 100%      # Unwrap all wrapped tokens
```

## When to Wrap vs Unwrap

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Wrap When">
    - A DEX pair requires the wrapped token
    - You want to provide liquidity
    - A specific trading feature needs ERC-20 tokens
    - You're using certain DeFi protocols
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Unwrap When">
    - You need native tokens for gas
    - You're withdrawing to an exchange
    - You're bridging (most bridges use native)
    - You want simpler wallet management
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Wrap/Unwrap Fees

Wrapping and unwrapping only costs gas — there's no protocol fee. It's a simple smart contract interaction that:
- Wrap: Takes native token, gives wrapped token 1:1
- Unwrap: Takes wrapped token, gives native token 1:1

<Info>
Keep some native tokens unwrapped for gas. If you wrap everything, you won't be able to pay for transactions.
</Info>

## High Balance Warning

When wrapping more than 80% of your native balance, AceBot shows a confirmation:

```
⚠️ You are about to wrap X tokens (Y% of balance).
Are you sure you want to continue?

[✅ Confirm] [❌ Cancel]
```

This protects you from accidentally wrapping all your gas funds.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Wrap/unwrap failed" icon="xmark">
    Common causes:
    - Insufficient balance for gas
    - Amount exceeds balance
    - Network congestion

    Solution: Ensure you have enough native tokens for gas and try again.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't see wrapped tokens" icon="eye-slash">
    - Use `/balance` to refresh
    - Wrapped tokens appear as a separate balance
    - Check you're viewing the correct chain
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Wrapped too much, can't pay gas" icon="gas-pump">
    If you wrapped all your native tokens:
    - Bridge a small amount from another chain
    - Receive tokens from another wallet
    - Use an exchange to send native tokens

    In future, use the 80% warning as a guide.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

1. **Keep 10-20% native** — Always maintain a reserve for gas
2. **Wrap only what you need** — Most trading works with native tokens
3. **Unwrap before bridging** — Most bridges use native tokens
4. **Check requirements** — Verify if your trade actually needs wrapped tokens

## Wrapped Token Addresses

| Chain | Wrapped Token Address |

<Tip>
AceBot handles wrapped token addresses automatically. You don't need to manually enter them for wrap/unwrap operations.
