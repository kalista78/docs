## Understanding Transaction Details

When viewing a transaction on an explorer:

### Transaction Hash

```
0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
```

### Status
- **Success** — Transaction completed
- **Pending** — Waiting for confirmation
- **Failed** — Transaction reverted

### Block
The block number where the transaction was included.

### From / To
- **From** — Your wallet address (for outgoing)
- **To** — The contract or address interacted with

### Value
Amount of native tokens transferred (if any).

### Gas Used
Amount of gas consumed by the transaction.

### Transaction Fee
Total gas cost (Gas Used × Gas Price).

## Reading Swap Transactions

For buy/sell transactions, look for:

### Input
What you sent (e.g., "10 S" or "1000 TOKEN").

### Output
What you received (shown in internal transactions or token transfers).

### Token Transfers
Section showing all token movements in the transaction.

## Tracking Position Performance

To track your trading performance:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Note Entry Price">
    When buying, record:
    - Token address
    - Amount bought
    - Price at purchase
    - Transaction hash
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track Current Price">
    Use **💰 Balances** to see current holdings and value.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Calculate P&L">
    Compare current value to entry value:
    - P&L = Current Value - Entry Value
    - % Gain = (Current - Entry) / Entry × 100
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Transaction Receipts

Each transaction in AceBot provides:
- Transaction hash
- Explorer link
- Basic confirmation status

Save these for your records or tax documentation.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Visit Explorer">
    Go to your chain's block explorer.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Search Your Address">

This shows current activity rather than historical transactions.
