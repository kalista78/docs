# Export Private Keys

For security, AceBot never displays private keys in Telegram chat. Instead, a secure external portal is provided for key access.

## Why Keys Aren't Shown in Chat

Displaying private keys in Telegram creates risks:
- **Screenshots** — Anyone with access to your phone could capture them
- **Message history** — Keys could remain in chat logs
- **Screen recording** — Malware could capture the display
- **Shoulder surfing** — Someone could see your screen

AceBot's approach protects you from these vectors.

## Accessing Your Private Keys

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Wallet Manager">
    Tap **👛 Wallets** from the main menu.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Your Wallet">
    Tap on the wallet you want to export.
  </Step>

  <Step title="View Key Access Info">
    Look for **Secure Key Info** or similar option.

    You'll see information about how to access the secure portal.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Access Secure Portal">
    If available, you'll receive a link to a secure web portal where you can:
    - View your private key
    - Copy it for backup
    - Export wallet credentials

    <Warning>
    Only access this portal on a secure, private device. Never on public computers or networks.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## If No Portal Is Available

If the secure portal isn't configured for your instance:
- Contact support through official channels
- Request manual key export assistance
- Never share account details in public channels

## Best Practices for Key Backup

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Store offline" icon="hard-drive">
    Write down your private key on paper or store it on an offline device. Digital storage on connected devices is risky.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use multiple copies" icon="copy">
    Keep backups in multiple secure locations. If one is lost or damaged, you have alternatives.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Never share" icon="user-secret">
    Your private key grants full control of your wallet. Never share it with anyone, including "support" staff.

  <Accordion title="Consider hardware wallet" icon="microchip">
    For large amounts, consider transferring to a hardware wallet (Ledger, Trezor) for maximum security.

## What to Do With Your Private Key

Once you have your private key, you can:

### Import to Other Wallets
Use your key to access the same wallet in:
- MetaMask
- Rabby
- Trust Wallet
- Any EVM-compatible wallet

This doesn't affect your AceBot wallet — both can access the same funds.

### Backup for Recovery
If you lose access to your Telegram account:
- Your AceBot account becomes inaccessible
- With your private key, you can recover funds to any wallet

### Migrate to Hardware Wallet
For long-term storage:
1. Set up a hardware wallet
2. Generate a new address
3. Transfer funds from AceBot wallet to hardware wallet
4. Keep small trading amounts in AceBot

## Security Warnings

<Warning>
**Never share your private key with anyone.**

AceBot support will never ask for your private key. Anyone who asks is attempting to steal your funds.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Verify URLs carefully.**

Phishing sites may impersonate the secure portal. Only access through official AceBot links.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Use secure devices.**

Access keys only on devices you control, with no malware, on private networks.
</Warning>
