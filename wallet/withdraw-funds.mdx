## Withdrawal Fees

When you withdraw:

| **Gas Fee** | Network fee for the transaction (varies by chain congestion) |
| **Platform Fee** | None for standard withdrawals |

The gas fee is shown on the confirmation screen before you approve.

<Info>
A small gas buffer (10 BPS) is automatically reserved when using MAX to ensure the transaction can complete.
</Info>

## Withdraw to Exchange

When withdrawing to a centralized exchange:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Deposit Address">
    Go to your exchange account and find the deposit address for the specific chain.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Network">
    Make sure you're copying the address for the correct network:
    - Sonic address for Sonic withdrawals
    - Monad address for Monad withdrawals
    - etc.

    <Warning>
    Sending to the wrong network can result in permanent loss of funds.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check Memo Requirements">
    Some exchanges require a memo or tag. If needed, contact support for guidance.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start with Small Amount">
    For first-time withdrawals to a new address, test with a small amount.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete Withdrawal">
    Follow the standard withdrawal process.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Withdraw All

To completely empty a wallet:

1. First, check if you have any ERC-20 tokens
2. Withdraw ERC-20 tokens first (they need native tokens for gas)
3. Finally, withdraw native tokens using the MAX preset

The MAX preset automatically calculates the maximum you can send after reserving gas for the transaction itself.

## Transaction Status

After confirming:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Pending** | Transaction submitted, waiting for confirmation |
| **Confirmed** | Transaction included in a block |
| **Failed** | Transaction reverted (funds returned) |

Click the explorer link to check real-time status.

## Troubleshooting Withdrawals

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Transaction is pending too long" icon="clock">
    Network congestion can delay confirmation. Check the explorer for status. In most cases, just wait.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Transaction failed" icon="xmark">
    Common causes:
    - Insufficient balance for gas
    - Invalid destination address
    - Network issues

    Your funds remain in your wallet if the transaction fails.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sent to wrong address" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Blockchain transactions are irreversible. If you sent to the wrong address:
    - If it's your address on another wallet, you can recover
    - If it's someone else's address, contact them directly
    - If it's an invalid address, funds may be lost
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tokens not showing in destination" icon="eye-slash">
    - Wait for full confirmation (check block explorer)
    - Add the token contract to your receiving wallet
    - Some wallets don't auto-detect all tokens
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Always double-check addresses.** Copy-paste instead of typing, and verify the first and last few characters.
</Tip>

1. **Test first** — Small test transaction before large amounts
2. **Correct network** — Verify you're on the right chain
3. **Save gas** — Keep some native tokens for future transactions
4. **Record keeping** — Save transaction hashes for your records
