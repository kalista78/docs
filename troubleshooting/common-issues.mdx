# Common Issues

Quick solutions to the most frequently encountered problems.

## Trading Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My trade keeps failing" icon="xmark">
    **Symptoms:** Trade fails with slippage error or reverts.

    **Solutions:**
    1. **Increase slippage** — Go to Settings → Slippage and increase by 5-10%
    2. **Check liquidity** — Low liquidity tokens need higher slippage
    3. **Try smaller amount** — Large trades have more price impact
    4. **Verify gas balance** — Ensure you have native tokens for gas
    5. **Wait and retry** — Network congestion can cause temporary failures

    If issues persist, the token may have trading restrictions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Got less tokens than expected" icon="chart-line-down">
    **Symptoms:** Received tokens are significantly less than the quote showed.

    **Causes:**
    - **Price movement** — Market moved between quote and execution
    - **Slippage** — Trade executed within your slippage tolerance
    - **Price impact** — Your trade size moved the market
    - **Token taxes** — Some tokens have buy/sell taxes

    **Prevention:**
    - Check token taxes before trading
    - Use lower slippage for stable tokens
    - Split large trades into smaller ones
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't sell a token (honeypot)" icon="honey-pot">
    **Symptoms:** Buy works but sell fails.

    **Cause:** The token is likely a honeypot — designed to trap your funds.

    **Solutions:**
    - Unfortunately, if it's a honeypot, recovery is usually impossible
    - In future, check GoPlus security warnings before buying
    - Verify tokens on [honeypot.is](https://honeypot.is) before trading

    **Prevention:**
    - Keep GoPlus security enabled in Settings
    - Be cautious with unknown tokens
    - Start with small test amounts
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Trade stuck on 'Processing'" icon="spinner">
    **Symptoms:** Trade shows processing but never completes.

    **Solutions:**
    1. Wait 2-3 minutes — transactions can take time during congestion
    2. Check your balance — funds may have moved even if status didn't update
    3. Use `/balance` to force refresh
    4. Check block explorer with transaction hash

    If truly stuck, the transaction will eventually timeout.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Wallet Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Balance shows 0 after depositing" icon="0">
    **Symptoms:** Deposited tokens but balance shows zero.

    **Solutions:**
    1. **Wait for confirmation** — Deposits can take 1-5 minutes
    2. **Force refresh** — Use `/balance` command
    3. **Check correct chain** — Make sure you're viewing the right network
    4. **Verify transaction** — Check your sending wallet's explorer for confirmation

    **Common mistakes:**
    - Sent tokens on wrong network
    - Sent to wrong address (typo)
    - Transaction still pending on source
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't find my wallet" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **Symptoms:** Wallet doesn't appear in the list.

    **Solutions:**
    1. **Check pagination** — Use ⬅️ ➡️ buttons to navigate pages
    2. **Refresh** — Close and reopen wallet manager
    3. **Verify account** — Ensure you're in the correct Telegram account

    Wallets cannot be recovered if:
    - They were deleted
    - You're using a different Telegram account
    - You never created/imported them
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Withdrawal failed" icon="money-bill-wave">
    **Symptoms:** Withdrawal transaction fails or reverts.

    **Solutions:**
    1. **Check gas** — Ensure enough native tokens for gas
    2. **Verify address** — Make sure destination is valid
    3. **Try smaller amount** — Leave some for gas fees
    4. **Retry** — Network issues can cause temporary failures

    If withdrawing to an exchange, verify you have the correct deposit address for that specific chain.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Bot Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Bot not responding" icon="robot">
    **Symptoms:** No response when tapping buttons or sending commands.

    **Solutions:**
    1. **Send /start** — Reset the bot session
    2. **Wait** — The bot may be temporarily busy
    3. **Check Telegram** — Ensure your connection is stable
    4. **Try later** — The bot may be under maintenance

    If issues persist for more than 15 minutes, check community channels for announcements.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Commands not working" icon="terminal">
    **Symptoms:** Commands like /buy or /balance don't work.

    **Solutions:**
    1. **Check syntax** — Ensure command format is correct
    2. **Use menu buttons** — Alternative to commands
    3. **Reset with /start** — Clear any stuck states
    4. **Verify bot** — Make sure you're using @AceBotApp
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Buttons not appearing" icon="square">
    **Symptoms:** Menus show without buttons or buttons don't respond.

    **Solutions:**
    1. **Tap /start** — Regenerates the main menu
    2. **Update Telegram** — Older versions may have issues
    3. **Check connection** — Slow connection can delay button loading
    4. **Restart Telegram** — Force close and reopen
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Chain Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Wrong chain selected" icon="link-slash">
    **Symptoms:** Trying to trade but tokens are on different chain.

    **Solutions:**
    1. **Switch chains** — Use `/chain` or Settings → Manage Chains
    2. **Bridge tokens** — Move tokens to desired chain
    3. **Check balances** — Verify where your tokens actually are
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Chain shows unavailable" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Symptoms:** A chain is grayed out or shows error.

    **Causes:**
    - Chain under maintenance
    - RPC issues
    - Temporarily disabled

    **Solutions:**
    - Wait and try again later
    - Use a different chain
    - Check community announcements for status updates
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Suspicious DM claiming to be support" icon="user-secret">
    **This is a SCAM.** Real AceBot support:
    - Never DMs you first
    - Never asks for private keys
    - Never asks for account passwords
    - Only communicates through official channels

    **What to do:**
    1. Block the scammer
    2. Report to Telegram
    3. Warn the community
    4. Never share any credentials
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Token flagged by security" icon="shield-halved">
    **Symptoms:** GoPlus warning when trying to trade.

    **What warnings mean:**
    - **Honeypot risk** — May not be able to sell
    - **High tax** — Significant buy/sell fees
    - **Blacklist** — Token can freeze your holdings

    **Decision:**
    - If you trust the token, you can proceed (at your risk)
    - Consider waiting for the project to address issues
    - When in doubt, don't trade
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
