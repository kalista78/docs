# Failed Transactions

When a transaction fails, your funds remain in your wallet. Here's how to diagnose and fix common failure causes.

## Understanding Transaction Failures

When a transaction fails:
1. **Your tokens are safe** — Failed transactions don't move funds
2. **Gas may be consumed** — Some failures still use gas
3. **You can retry** — Usually with adjusted settings

## Common Failure Reasons

### Slippage Exceeded

**Error:** "Slippage tolerance exceeded" or "INSUFFICIENT_OUTPUT_AMOUNT"

**What happened:** The price moved more than your allowed slippage between when you submitted and when the transaction executed.

**Fix:**
<Steps>
  <Step title="Increase Slippage">
    Go to **⚙️ Settings** → **Slippage** and increase by 5-10%.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Retry Trade">
    Submit the trade again with higher slippage.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Recommended slippage:**
| Token Type | Slippage |
|------------|----------|
| Stable/Blue chip | 1-3% |
| Medium volatility | 5-15% |
| High volatility | 15-30% |
| New launches | 30-50% |

### Insufficient Gas

**Error:** "Insufficient funds for gas" or "Out of gas"

**What happened:** You don't have enough native tokens to pay for the transaction.

**Fix:**
<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Balance">
    Use `/balance` to see your native token balance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Funds">
    Deposit more native tokens (S, MON, ETH, etc.).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reduce Trade Size">
    If trading native tokens, leave some for gas.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Always keep at least 1-5% of your balance as native tokens for gas.
</Tip>

### Insufficient Balance

**Error:** "Insufficient balance" or "Transfer amount exceeds balance"

**What happened:** You tried to trade more tokens than you have.

**Fix:**
- Check your actual balance with `/balance`
- Reduce trade amount
- Account for any pending transactions

---

### Price Impact Too High

**Error:** "Price impact too high" or similar

**What happened:** Your trade size would move the market price significantly.

**Fix:**
<Steps>
  <Step title="Reduce Size">
    Trade a smaller amount.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Split Into Multiple">
    Do several smaller trades instead of one large one.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use DCA">
    Spread the trade over time with DCA orders.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Token Has Sell Restrictions

**Error:** "Transfer failed" or transaction reverts on sell

**Possible causes:**
- **Honeypot** — Token designed to prevent selling
- **Blacklist** — Your address was blocked by the token
- **Cooldown** — Token has trading cooldown period
- **Max wallet** — Selling would leave you with invalid amount

**Investigation:**
1. Check if others can sell (community/socials)
2. Review token contract on block explorer
3. Check GoPlus security report

<Warning>
If it's a honeypot, your funds may be unrecoverable. This is why GoPlus warnings are important.
</Warning>

---

### Network Congestion

**Error:** Transaction pending for extended time, then fails

**What happened:** Network was too congested and your transaction wasn't included before timing out.

**Fix:**
- Wait for network congestion to reduce
- Retry during lower traffic periods
- Some chains have peak hours — avoid those times

---

### Contract Execution Failed

**Error:** "Execution reverted" or contract-specific error

**Possible causes:**
- DEX router issue
- Liquidity pool drained
- Contract paused
- Invalid token pair

**Fix:**
1. Wait and retry — temporary issues often resolve
2. Try a different token pair
3. Check if the DEX/token has known issues

## Checking Transaction Status

To investigate a failed transaction:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Transaction Hash">
    AceBot provides a transaction hash when you submit.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Block Explorer">
    Go to the explorer for your chain (sonicscan.org, monadvision.com, etc.).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search Transaction">
    Paste the transaction hash in the search bar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Status">
    Look for:
    - **Status:** Success, Failed, or Pending
    - **Error Message:** If failed, reason is often shown
    - **Gas Used:** How much gas was consumed
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Transaction Still Pending

If your transaction is stuck pending:

| Wait Time | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| < 2 min | Normal, just wait |
| 2-5 min | Check explorer, may be congested |
| 5-15 min | Likely stuck or failed silently |
| 15+ min | Transaction probably failed, retry |

Most stuck transactions eventually fail and can be replaced.

## Recovering From Failures

After a failed transaction:

1. **Verify balance** — Your tokens should still be there
2. **Diagnose cause** — Use this guide to identify the issue
3. **Adjust settings** — Fix slippage, amount, or wait for conditions to improve
4. **Retry** — Submit the transaction again

<Info>
Failed transactions don't double-spend. If you retry immediately after a failure, you won't lose funds twice.
</Info>
